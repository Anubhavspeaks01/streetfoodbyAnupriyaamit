🧾 A2P-Bazaar: Transparent Raw Material Pricing for Street Vendors





📌 Problem Statement
Hidden Costs and Inconsistent Pricing in Raw Material Sourcing
Street food vendors face unfair pricing, daily chaos, and zero transparency in sourcing raw materials.

❗ Real-World Challenges
Vendors waste time visiting multiple suppliers for best prices.

Price changes are random — there's no historical record or transparency.

They rarely receive bills or receipts.

There's no way to prove unfair price hikes.

They're trapped in an unorganized, informal market system.
